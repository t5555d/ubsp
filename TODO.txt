TODO
- support enums and/or tables
+ embed init in for loop nodes
- implement import (e.g. for SEI messages)
+ infer variable values (if they are not loaded)
+ support dependent-length codes, e.g. u(v), i(v)
- check variable values (that are supposed to be fixed)
- pre-analyze variables: which are local and which are global
+ correct implementation of NALU/RBSP streams
+ support selected SEI messages
- check that variables are set on all control paths
